      <h1>The Makings of "Little Breitbart"</h1>

      <h2>A deep-dive into VDare, a non-profit right-wing media outlet funded by right-wing millionaires, and how their donations weaponized philanthropy</h2>


      <h3> By Irene Spezzamonte, Vanessa Swales & Sharif Paget </h3>


      <p>In a nine-room Mid-Century modern home with large glass windows overlooking Bantam river and located a hundred yards from the main road of provincial Litchfield, Connecticut, resides a non-profit right-wing media outlet called VDare. It is also
        the home and headquarters of Peter Brimelow, the British-born founder and editor-in-chief, whose rise to media power and influence in the discussion of anti-immigration politics has grown over the past two decades.</p>


      <p> Under his name on the same address reside VDare a right-wing publication that focuses on “the unsustainability of current US immigration policy.” But it is not alone. Registered at the same address and with the same founder - Peter Brimelow - resides
        Happy Penguins LLC, that has been receiving money from VDare for “leased employees.” </p>

      <p> Living under the same roof, Brimlow himself, his wife Lydia and their four children </p>

      <p>The rise of social media and online news sites have unleashed a new frontier in the battle of ideas. Right-wing millionaires have found a way to push their anti-immigration agenda through non-profits. This is how they have weaponized philanthropy.</p>

      <p> Following the growing consumption of larger news outlets, such as FoxNews and Breitbart, smaller lesser-known right-wing publications gained traction in the run up to the 2016 Presidential election. </p>

      <p>VDare, a right-wing publication on the web, is a case-study on how this battle of ideas is getting waged. Despite being largely under the radar, the site is on the front lines of?, netting millions in donations as it espouses anti-immigration ideology.
        The funding VDare receives comes from a network of well established conservative groups, led by the Scaife Family, the Federation for American Immigration (FAIR) and Numbers USA, who donate to prestigious universities such as Harvard Law, in order
        to create programs to promote their ideas, and well-established conservative magazines such as the National Review. Since some may not want to be associated with VDare’s vehement point of view, they opt to funnel cash through smaller nonprofits
        who then transfer it to VDare. In turn, equipped with writers and editors, the site - which has been included in the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/vdare" target="_blank">Southern Poverty Law Center’s database</a>        of hate groups - efficiently utilizes social media to get its message out. </p>

      <p>The rise of VDare is unusual to say the least; it takes many twists and turns and deviates from the norm when it comes to non-profits. To understand VDare, one must first start with its founder: Peter Brimelow.</p>

      <p>VDare is not the only product Brimelow created: HappyPenguins LLC is the financial crutch of the non-profit. VDare paid a total of about $1.5 million to the HappyPenguins for “leased employees” from 2010 to 2015, 990s documents show. </p>

      <p> VDare gets its name from Virginia Dare, the first European to be born in North America. The site is said to espouse white supremacist ideas by Southern Poverty Law Center, which Brimelow has rejected. </p>

      <p>VDare was started by English born Peter Brimelow to “inform the fight to keep America American,” according to the site's mission statement. Brimelow's America is not a melting pot or tossed salad, instead it is an ethnostate where “demography is
        destiny.” </p>

      <p>“America is not a country of immigrants, it's a country of settlers,” Brimelow said in an interview last year. And every four years his foundation gets large donations from right-wing millionaires to push this agenda.</p>

      <p> Brimelow was born in the U.K. and got his MBA from Stanford University in 1972. He started his career as writer with a book about how to get rich from investment newsletters. Almost a decade later, he would publish another book. This time it wouldn’t
        be a get-rich quick book, but would take aim at immigration in America. “Alien Nation: Common Sense About America’s Immigration Disaster,” warns that the United States is facing an existential crisis. Brimelow uses his economics background to
        paint a picture of a country that will be bankrupt by it’s influx of immigrants who don’t pay taxes. A theory which was been thoroughly debunked by most economists. </p>

      <p> Brimelow found his voice as a journalist in the late 80s when he became a columnist for Forbes. There he established his career when he later became a senior editor. In 2012 he was a contributor for MarketWatch writing about stocks, gold and the
        flow of markets in general. </p>

      <p>The year that pushed Brimelow’s career was, however, 1999. That year he founded both: the Center for American Unity, where he was the president, and VDare. </p>

        </iframe>



      <p> In 1999, Peter Brimelow created the Center for American Unity, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit, in which he served as its first president. The executive vice-president, Edith Dinnseen Hakola, described the center’s objective as <a href="http://www.proconservative.net/PCVol3IS43MassImm.shtml"
          target="_blank">“making other Americans aware of the many problems and dangers that mass immigration represents and persuading them to do something about it.”</a> </p>

      <p> At the time, Brimelow also served as editor of the center’s magazine the Unity Review, which was published online as VDare.com. </p>

      <p> However, in a tweet published on the VDare website on December 16, 2008, Brimelow wrote: “VDARE.COM is no longer associated with the Center For American Unity, which plans to focus on litigation. We are grateful for their past help and wish them
        well in future. Our sponsor is now the VDARE Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity.” </p>

      <p> Attempts to contact Hakola and other board members from the Center were not successful and The reasons behind the separation cannot be determined. </p>

      <p> Although <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/0529179" target="_blank"> public records </a> show the company is now terminated, the center allowed Brimelow to create what is now the focus of his career: VDare. </p>

      <p> He was also a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, a free market think tank based in California. It was at Pacific Research Institute where he received a $200,000 grant.</p>

      <p>Prior to 2001, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15yAwwcXsFSyAa49aHJcJ7IuLbzsz06i6/view" target="_blank"> proposals </a> authorized for grants by the John M. Olin Foundation to projects and causes specifically involving public policy research,
        American institutions, law and legal system and strategic and international studies. It is unknown what Brimelow’s proposal fell under when requesting a grant for VDare. However, in the schedule of grants for 2000, the $200,000 grant was authorized
        to the Pacific Research Institute for the purpose of putting the money towards “vdare.com, an Internet journal edited by Peter Brimelow”. The grant payment was done in two installments- $100,000 paid before 2000 and $100,000 paid in 2000.</p>


      <p> VDare’s biggest donations come from three main foundations; Galbraith, Colcom and Armstrong Foundations. All of these foundations have connections with other well known right-wing publications such as FoxNews, Breitbart and National Review. </p>

      <p> The origins of VDare are fairly checkered. Originally started up under the name of Center for American Unity. While Brimelow was the president there, he received a grant of $100,000 from the John M. Olin Foundation, a now-dissolved conservative
        think tank, one of the top five wealthy conservatives lobbyists of 20th century, Jane Mayer wrote in her book ‘Dark Money.’ This grant allowed him to start the Lexington Research Institute, which was the initial name for VDare. </p>


      <p> Piereson was a fundamental figure in the John M. Olin Foundation. He was the mind behind the “beachhead theory” by which, according to him, the foundation needed to “to establish conservative cells, or ‘beachheads’, at the most influential schools
        in order to gain the greatest leverage,” Mayer wrote. </p>

      <p> Piereson declined to comment about his role in the John M. Olin Foundation and its ties with Peter Brimelow and VDare. </p>

      <p>The sole purpose of the John M Olin Foundation was to donate money to prominent schools in the country in order to shape the professors and the students’ mindset about politics creating a more conservative political environment, Jane Mayer writes
        in her book ‘Dark Money’. </p>

      <p> “His foundation aimed at the country’s most elite schools, the Ivy League and its peers, cognizant that these schools were the incubators of those who would hold future power.” Mayer writes. </p>

      <p>The American institutions the John M Olin Foundation continuously donated to included Columbia, Cornell, Fordham, New York University, Princeton, Stanford, University of California (Berkeley), Yale and Harvard. Harvard has been the main focus for
        the foundation. In 2003 the Foundation donated $10M to Harvard Law School the The John M. Olin Center for Law, Economics, and Business. This would be “the largest foundation grant in the Law school’s 186-year history,”<a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/hls-receives-10m-grant-from-olin-foundation/"
          target="_blank"> press release. </a>
      </p>

      <p> As a testimony of this trend, the foundation donated in 2000 - the same year it donated the money to Brimelow - to 21 publications which included campus magazines as well as newsletters for almost a total of $1.8 million in donations.</p>

      <p> Since its initial creation as “a national non-profit educational organisation dedicated to preserving our historical unity as American into the twenty-first century,” the center changed its name to Lexington Research Institute. In 2007, it officially
        became VDare.com. The name was not picked randomly. </p>

      <p> Brimelow played a vital role of the organization. He is both its chairman and editor-in-chief. </p>

      <p> Elections and post-elections years seem to represent the years in which VDare is able to collect the most money. In 2009, for example, right after Barack Obama was elected for the first time, VDare recorded a total of $3.780 million in contributions,
        970 percent more than the year before. </p>

      <p> The same year, coincidentally, Brimelow decided to found HappyPenguins LLC, a figure that Brimelow would <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-let-white-nationalist-groups-raise-millions-claiming-theyre-charities-ap-says/" target="_blank"> define </a>        fundamental to “protect himself and his employees.” </p>

      <p> Starting from 2010, HappyPenguins LLC started to appear in the 990s of VDare. The documents show how VDare payed the LLC to pay for “leased employees.” That year Brimelow’s salary stopped to be included in the 990s. </p>

      <p> Both VDare and HappyPenguins LLC are registered at the same address in Connecticut. The nine-room colonial home also happens to be Brimelow’s personal address, <a href="https://publicrecords.netronline.com/state/CT/" target="_blank"> according to the Connecticut Public Records. </a>

        <p> Donald S. Hendel, the Connecticut-based lawyer, who specializes in wealth preservation planning and also the registered agent of HappyPenguins LLC, was not available for comment.</p>

        <p> Such practice is not illegal, Daniel Tinkelman, a non-profit accountant, and Gene Takagi, a lawyer specialized in non-profits, say. However, this might question the ethical standards of the entire VDare operation and of Brimelow themself. Such
          line might not be crossed with necessarily create illegality. </p>

        <p> The year when Obama was running for re-election, VDare scored another high. They received a total of $1.9 million in contributions, grift and grant. This was its second largest amount of donations the no-profit registered in its history, 990s
          show. That year Gailbraith donated $1,500,000. </p>

        <p> VDare today reaches about 7,000 unique visitors daily as opposed to the 10.600 millions visitors that Brieitbart receives daily. </p>

        <p> In order to push VDare’s content a step further, Brimelow decided to move all the social media activity from Facebook to Twitter. </p>

        <p> “I'm getting complaints about shadow-banning etc. and now Zuck is threatening even more anti-news changes to the Facebook algorithm.” Brimelow wrote on the VDare Facebook page in February. “I'm fed up with it and I think I'll switch our Facebook
          page over to our Twitter feed for a while to see how it goes.” </p>

        <p> For publications, Twitter has become more popular because it is easier and cheaper to use, Nick Monaco, who works at the computational propaganda project in California explains. </p>

        <p> “Twitter has a high scale of automation and the news on Twitter spreads really quickly. It is like snowball that keeps growing.” Monaco said. </p>

        <p> Publications have decide to start promoting their content on Twitter especially after Mark Zuckerberg announced he was introducing a new algorithm on Facebook that would prioritize content from friends. </p>

        <p> In order to promote content on Facebook, publications need to purchase ads. Meanwhile, content on Twitter is promoted through hashtags. In order to be successful, publications “hijack hashtags”. </p>

        <p> Publications would take an hashtag that is going viral and insert it in their Tweet even if that specific hashtag is not relevant to the story. </p>

        <p> “It is a way of political manipulation.” Monaco said. </p>

        <p> Although VDare does not directly partake in the “hijacking hashtags” phenomenon, Brimelow does, in fact, vehemently push his agenda on Twitter. On April first, for instance, he wrote sharing a VDare article: “We agree, Martin Luther King was a
          radical. That's we say every year that he's not a suitable role model for Americans and his Day should be abolished.” </p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
          <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We agree, Martin Luther King was a radical. That&#39;s we say every year <a href="https://t.co/3KXH0Tumzr">https://t.co/3KXH0Tumzr</a> that he&#39;s not a suitable role model for Americans and his Day should be abolished <a href="https://t.co/cJtcy6JaQh">https://t.co/cJtcy6JaQh</a></p>&mdash;
          Peter Brimelow (@peterbrimelow) <a href="https://twitter.com/peterbrimelow/status/980598263777775616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2018</a></blockquote>
        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        <p>Scrolling through the VDare Twitter page, it is also noticeable how the page shares the same articles twice not even within hours between the first shared article and the second one. </p>

        <p> VDare is more than a non-profit organization writing about anti-immigration policies. It’s a family business. </p>

        <p> Lydia Brimelow, Peter’s wife, also chief advancement officer and writer for VDare.com as well as being a member for HappyPenguins LLC. </p>

        <p> “Patriots have legal rights and that corporate caving to Leftist pressure has costs,” Brimelow wrote in March after an Hilton hotel decided to cancel their Immigration Reform Conference in Arizona. “Some small comfort is that these cancellations
          always produce local expressions of support from Americans who are shocked to realize that they no longer live in the Land of the Free, so they do play a cumulative educational role.”</p>

        <p> John Brimelow, Peter’s twin brother, is a board member at VDare as well, 990s show. However, he doesn’t write for the website. </p>

        <p> Peter Brimelow was not immediately available for comment for this story. </p>
